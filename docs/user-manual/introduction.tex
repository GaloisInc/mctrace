\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This is the User Manual for MCTrace. The source for this manual can be
found within the repository in the directory \texttt{docs/user-manual}.

In addition to providing instructions for building a Docker image
suitable for running MCTrace in the development environment provided by
the software, \texttt{README.md} includes instructions for building a
standalone Docker image that is suitable for use by a user who is not
interested in development or in the source code. Use of the standalone
Docker image is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:user-release}.

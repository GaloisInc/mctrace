\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This is the User Manual for MCTrace, updated to correspond with the
software release as of the end of AMP Phase 2 (7/28/23).  This manual
can be found within the repository snapshot comprising the Phase 2 code delivery,
in the directory \texttt{docs/usermanual}.  

In addition to building a Docker image suitable for running MCTrace in
the development environment provided by the software archive, README.md
includes instructions for building a standalone Docker image, suitable
for use by a potential user who is not interested in development or in
the source code provided in the archive. Our intention is to provide
this standalone Docker image on request, rather than expecting
prospective users to build it themselves. Use of the standalone Docker
image is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:user-release}.
